                        as efficiently as humans. This makes them more prone to heat-related conditions, particularly in
                        hot weather, such as during summer. To avoid heatstroke, pigs need to be kept cool, and this is
                        why it's essential to bathe or wet them down, especially during hot weather.</p>

        <p>Why is it important to follow the proper distribution of feeds depending on the age of the pig? The proper
            distribution of feeds according to the age of the pig is important to meet their nutritional needs. Young
            pigs
            require high-protein feeds for growth, while older pigs need feeds that are high in energy and carbohydrates
            for
            weight gain. Failure to meet the proper feeding requirements can lead to poor growth and health problems.
            Proper
            feeding helps ensure healthy growth, optimizes productivity, and minimizes feed wastage, which ultimately
            results in better profits for the farmer.</p>
        <p>If we install a temperature sensor in the farrowing crate of the sow to monitor the body temperature and
            detect
            if it reaches a set abnormal temperature, when will the automatic sprinkler turn on, and for how many
            minutes
            should it operate? What temperature triggers the sprinkler, and how many minutes is needed to ensure the sow
            gets wet? To monitor the sow's body temperature, the automatic sprinkler should be set to activate when the
            sow’s temperature rises above the normal range. Typically, pigs can suffer from heat stress when their body
            temperature exceeds 39°C (102.2°F). The sprinkler should turn on when the temperature reaches around 39°C.
        </p>
        <p>Once the sprinkler activates, it should run for 5-10 minutes to ensure the sow is properly cooled down. This
            duration is enough to provide cooling and reduce the risk of heatstroke. The goal is to lower the body
            temperature of the sow and help her maintain comfort, especially in hot conditions.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between a veterinarian and a technician in pig farming? The difference between a
            veterinarian and a technician in pig farming lies primarily in their roles, training, and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A veterinarian (often referred to as a veterinary doctor) is a highly trained professional with a degree
                in
                veterinary medicine. They are responsible for diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases in pigs.
                They
                are qualified to perform surgeries, prescribe medications, and handle complex medical conditions.
                Veterinarians also provide health advice and management strategies for livestock.</li>
            <li>A veterinary technician (or animal health technician) is a skilled professional who works under the
                supervision of a veterinarian. They are trained in animal care and medical procedures but are not
                licensed
                to diagnose or prescribe treatments on their own. Their duties include assisting with medical
                procedures,
                administering vaccines, conducting health checks, and ensuring proper care and treatment for pigs under
                the
                veterinarian's direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, veterinarians have more advanced qualifications and can independently diagnose and treat animals,
            while veterinary technicians assist with tasks under veterinary supervision.</p>

        <h6>
            Essential tips for pig farmers to prevent risks, sickness, and diseases in pigs:
        </h6>
        <p> 1. Maintain Proper Hygiene and Cleanliness: Regular cleaning and sanitizing of pig pens, feeding areas, and
            equipment will help prevent the spread of disease. Make sure the pigs have clean bedding and access to fresh
            water.</p>
        <p>2. Proper Nutrition: Feed your pigs a balanced diet that is appropriate for their age and growth stage.
            Ensure
            they get the right type of feed (gestating, lactating, growing, etc.) and supplements, like vitamins and
            minerals, to maintain good health and immunity.</p>
        <p>3. Vaccination: Vaccinate your pigs regularly according to veterinary guidelines to protect them from common
            diseases like ASF (African Swine Fever), hog cholera, and other infections.</p>
        <p> 4. Monitor Pig Health: Regularly check your pigs for signs of illness, such as loss of appetite, coughing,
            fever, or unusual behavior. Early detection of illness can prevent the spread of disease and reduce
            treatment
            costs.</p>
        <p> 5. Quarantine New Pigs: Always quarantine new pigs before introducing them to your farm. This helps prevent
            the
            introduction of diseases that might not show symptoms immediately.</p>
        <p> 6. Control Pests and Rodents: Pests and rodents can carry diseases that can infect pigs. Implement rodent
            and
            pest control measures on your farm to minimize the risk.</p>
        <p> 7. Maintain Good Ventilation: Ensure proper ventilation in pig pens to avoid respiratory diseases. Stale air
            and
            overcrowding can lead to stress and health problems in pigs.</p>
        <p> 8. Limit Visitors and Farm Traffic: Minimize visitors to your farm and ensure any necessary workers follow
            proper biosecurity measures like wearing clean clothes and using disinfectants to prevent the spread of
            disease.</p>
        <p> 9. Proper Waste Management: Proper disposal of manure and waste is crucial to prevent the spread of
            diseases.
            Make sure the waste is stored and disposed of in a safe and sanitary manner.</p>
        <p>10. Work with a Veterinarian: Regularly consult with a veterinarian to stay informed about disease outbreaks,
            vaccinations, and preventive treatments. A good relationship with a veterinary professional can help you
            manage
            your farm's health effectively.</p>

        <h6>Advice for farmers who are planning to buy piglets for the first time to avoid wasting capital and reduce
            risks:</h6>
        <p>1. Buy from Reputable Sources: Ensure that you buy piglets from reliable and trusted breeders or farms. It's
            crucial to check the health status of the piglets before purchase. Avoid buying from questionable sources
            that could lead to diseases or poor-quality piglets.</p>
        <p>2. Check for Health and Disease History: Before buying piglets, ensure that they are free from diseases such
            as ASF, Hog Cholera, and other common pig diseases. Ask for the health history and vaccination records of
            the piglets. If possible, have a veterinarian examine them before purchasing.</p>
        <p>3. Consider Age and Size: Choose piglets that are of the right age and size for your farm’s requirements.
            Ensure they are weaned properly and are strong enough to survive in your farm environment.</p>
        <p> 4. Inspect Their Behavior and Physical Condition: Healthy piglets should be active, alert, and have a good
            appetite. Check for any signs of illness such as coughing, diarrhea, or visible wounds. Piglets should also
            have clean and smooth skin.</p>

        <h6>Proper Burial and Euthanization of Pigs Infected with ASF:</h6>
        <div>
            <p>1. Euthanization of Infected Pigs: The first step in handling ASF-infected pigs is to euthanize them to
                prevent further spread of the disease. This can be done using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Injection of a euthanasia solution (if available and authorized).</li>
                <li>Using a firearm or blunt trauma (if euthanasia solution is not available).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>2. Proper Burial Procedure: After euthanization, the infected pigs must be buried properly to prevent
                disease spread. The burial procedures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depth of the Burial: The burial pit should be at least 10 feet (approximately 3 meters) deep to
                    ensure that scavengers cannot access the carcasses.</li>
                <li>Location of the Burial: The burial site should be far from water sources, other farms, or public
                    areas to avoid contamination.</li>
                <li>Covering of Carcasses: After placing the pigs in the pit, cover them with a thick layer of soil
                    mixed with lime or disinfectants to aid decomposition and prevent disease transmission.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>3. Why the Department of Agriculture Should Execute These Procedures: The Department of Agriculture has
                the authority and expertise to handle disease outbreaks. They should be responsible for euthanizing and
                burying the infected pigs to ensure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expert handling and resources to prevent further contamination.</li>
                <li>Proper monitoring and control of the spread of ASF.</li>
                <li>Compliance with biosecurity protocols that protect other farms and the community.</li>
                <li>Legal authority and responsibility in managing disease outbreaks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>4. Why the DA Should Take Over if the Farmer Refuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public Health and Safety: ASF is highly contagious and poses a serious threat to the swine industry
                    and public health. If the farmer refuses to follow proper protocols, it could lead to the spread of
                    ASF to nearby farms and communities, endangering the entire industry.</li>
                <li>Legal Responsibility: The Department of Agriculture is mandated by law to control the spread of
                    animal diseases. This includes the right to enforce quarantine measures, euthanize infected animals,
                    and dispose of them properly to prevent further outbreaks. If a farmer refuses to comply, the DA has
                    the authority to take action to protect public welfare.</li>
                <li>Preventing Further Contamination: Allowing the farmer to decide against euthanizing infected pigs
                    could result in the continued spread of ASF. The DA must take responsibility to ensure that
                    biosecurity measures are followed strictly and that proper action is taken, even if the owner
                    refuses.</li>
                <li>Biosecurity and National Safety: ASF is a highly contagious disease that can cause economic
                    devastation to the entire swine industry. The DA's involvement ensures that the disease is managed
                    properly, without risking further economic losses or human health threats from infected pigs.</li>
